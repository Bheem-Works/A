FREE WRITTING : 
[TODAY WAS A GREAT DAY. AND ALL DAY I WAS HAVING THE TENSE ABOUT THE EXAM. I WAS TAKING MANY TENSION ABOUT THE ACCOUNT EXAMS. 
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND WHAT TO EARN HOWEVER I MANAGED TO LEARN AND TRY SOME STUFF. BUT I DON'T THINK IT WIILL BE ENOUGH. 
I DO HAVE LACK OF CONFIDENT AND I THINK I MIGHT BE FALL AND  WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I FAIL AND DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE ANSWER. 
WELL I HAVE PERPARED SOME OF THIS THIN'GS. AND YEH MY JOURNAL AND THE ALL STUFF ARE REMAINGIN AND I DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING'S 
AT THIS NOTE ABOUT THE YESTERDAY THING'S THERE ARE MANY HEART BROKEN THING'S WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO SAY BUT NOT RIGHT NOW. 
THE TIME IS NOT GOOD FOR ME. EVERYTHING'S IS CLOPPASED AND FAR AWAY FROM ME.  
THERE ARE COUPLE OF THE THING'S THAT I WANT TO SAY BUT RIGHT  I HAVE  NOT FEEL LIKE TO TELL. AND YEH I AM HAVING THE PROBLEM WITH THE 
KEYSTROKE OF THE L BUTTON RIGHT NOW THIS IS THE ISSUE RIGHT. MY MIND IS THINKING SO MUCH AND I DON'T WANT THAT MY SHOULD THINK ABOUT 
MORE WASTAGE THING'S WHICH   I DONT'T WANT TO THINK BUT YEH IT'S SEEM SO HARD RIGHT. AND DON'T KNWO WHAT TO DO. BRUH I FEEL LIKE I AM IN 
THE JAIL SOME TIMES THERE IS MANY THIN'GS BUT CAN NOT DO ANYTHING'S FEEL LIKES I AM ALONE AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM AND THE PROBLEM IS THE FACT YESH I AM ALONE  PERSON RIGHT NOW. SO ALONE PERSON RIGHT NOW. AND DON'T HOPE WHERE I EXPECTED THAT I WOULD GET SOME MOTIVITATION.]
