FREE WRITTING : 
[TODAY WAS A GREAT DAY. AND ALL DAY I WAS HAVING THE TENSE ABOUT THE EXAM. I WAS TAKING MANY TENSION ABOUT THE ACCOUNT EXAMS. 
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND WHAT TO EARN HOWEVER I MANAGED TO LEARN AND TRY SOME STUFF. BUT I DON'T THINK IT WIILL BE ENOUGH. 
I DO HAVE LACK OF CONFIDENT AND I THINK I MIGHT BE FALL AND  WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I FAIL AND DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE ANSWER. 
WELL I HAVE PERPARED SOME OF THIS THIN'GS. AND YEH MY JOURNAL AND THE ALL STUFF ARE REMAINGIN AND I DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING'S 
AT THIS NOTE ABOUT THE YESTERDAY THING'S THERE ARE MANY HEART BROKEN THING'S WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO SAY BUT NOT RIGHT NOW. 
THE TIME IS NOT GOOD FOR ME. EVERYTHING'S IS CLOPPASED AND FAR AWAY FROM ME. ]
