#### Date : July 19, Day(tuesday); 

## Descriptions about day: 
The Descriptions about the day is that today day was not quite nice. <br /> 
I have changed a lot and i needed to changed for my self. I have to regain my selfrespect. 
The way i broke my swear the way i broke my people trust. That is unforgattable. 
let's talk about the today only. <br /> <br /> 
The day was pretty good. i just came back to home and watch some videos in youtube and other's stuff. 

## Event** (let's talk about the event): 
Event but in very short -: My heart got broke as much as i love her, i smoked, i stop caring thing's, i broke my consistent routine,
making parents dissapoint, not goint college, not reading like this all stuff.. , blaming my self.

There are many couples of thing's that i don't want to talk about it. And i have to talk about that thing's clearly but tommorow.

For now today : I have to <b> Say <b /> <i> Good bye! <i />
