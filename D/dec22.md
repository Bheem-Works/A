challenge part : I am trying to control my emotions and the facial expression and sometimes i found my sel succed on it.

I have been meditation a quite and i found my self i can control my emotions and the angerness and the jealousy and i don't think i am happy  but i think i am peace right now.


The Meditation goal will be around for an 30 minutes per day;
And let's see how much can i improve and control my self and build a patience for my self.
