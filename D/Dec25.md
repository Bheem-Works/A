Want to say something's in this christmash moment : 

God please blessed on my family. I don't want to see that any one suffer in this year or we gonna loose some important person. 
There are many of those bad thing's which is happened in this year. I can not even explain how much bad things happened today. 
But in the speak of the truth i have to say that. 

whatever, happened to us We admit that and we accept that the pain what you have gaven what does the fate has gaven to us 
we swallow that pain and i become the stronger then i was before.
